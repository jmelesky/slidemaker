(this is an example of how you do the low-rent version of incremental slides)

# Magic!

A file called 'index.html' is produced.

(assuming you have the markdown2 python library installed. please do
that, btw)

# Magic, cont'd

Of course, it relies on jquery (not included) being available in the
scripts/ directory. This was tested with jquery 1.2.3. Other versions
probably work, maybe (i have obviously not kept up with jquery
development and any interface changes they've made).

# Magic, once more

Oh, hey, it's markdown, so i can [link to the jquery
project](http://jquery.com/).

# How to use

`Space` or mouse click is forward-slide.

Same with `right-arrow`. `Left-arrow` backs up.

`Up-arrow` and `down-arrow` go to the first and last slides,
respectively.

`Esc` pulls out of the slideshow mode, and shows all the slides. Click
on one to go back into slideshow mode (this is handy if you lose your
place and want to search for a keyword).

---
# How it works

`make_slides.py` parses this file, converting each bit to html
snippets using markdown. Each snippet becomes an html `div`, with the
'slide' class, in the final html. The slideshow.js javascript takes
all the 'slide' `div`s and hides them, stacks them in order, and
manages input and transition (with some help from jquery).

# Patches welcome

Go ahead and submit a pull request. I'm flexible.

# License

BSD-style. Feel free to tear apart the component pieces to your own
ends.

Just, you know, try not to be a jerk about it.

# That's it!

End of the documentation, and end of the example slides.
